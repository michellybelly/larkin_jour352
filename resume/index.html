<h2 class="SECTION"> OVERVIEW </h2>
<p> I'm an English and Multimedia Journalism senior at The University of Maryland. My work has been published through UMD's Howard Center, The Diamondback, The Mitzpeh and my own website. My preferred concentration in journalism is investigative and activism journalism, as I try to include marginalized and low-income communities in my stories. I feel like it's essential to include every voice to a story and broaden perspectives among readers, especially when I'm a Korean woman whose mother is an immigrant. I hope to tell people's and communities' stories on a bigger platform in the future and signal equity and inclusion  </p>
