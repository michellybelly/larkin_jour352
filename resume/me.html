          <p> My name is Michelle Larkin (she/her/hers) and I'm a student journalist and writer at the University of Maryland. My journalistic interests revolve around politics, feature writing, lifestyle and activism journalism. </p>

          <p> In the future, I'm hoping to get a career that deals with feature writing and/or writing about human rights and social issues. Coming from a single immigrant mother from South Korea, I take great pride in who I am and want to share other marginalized communities' stories. In my personal opinion, journalism is a powerful tool in capturing those who feel like they have no voice. It's essential for journalists, like myself, to tell the stories of those who feel like they are often left ignored. </p>

          <p> With that, I also am working on a podcast that will explore issues surrounding women's rights and feminism. This site that you are on right now is still under construction - but I will update it in the near future with my podcast! Stay tuned. </p>

          <p> My beat in spring 2022 was admissions and financial aid with The Diamondback. Some of my stories include topics dealing with SAT/ACT scores and the exclusiveness behind it and limited enrollment programs being lifted at the University of Maryland. But now I cover equity/identity/justice issues at UMD and in the College Park, Maryland area. </p>

          <p> I am fluent in English and Korean. I am also familiar with GitHub, Atom, Adobe Cloud, Photoshop, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. </p>

          <p> Whenever I'm not reading up on the latest news or interviewing, I like to do my makeup and write poetry. My favorite poet is Walt Whitman and I hope to publish a poetry book in the near future, too. </p>

          <p> I am a Starbucks addict and a Dua Lipa stan. One of the reasons I'm becoming a journalist is so I can maybe interview Dua Lipa one day (jk but maybe not jk hehe). </p>
